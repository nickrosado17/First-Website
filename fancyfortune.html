    <h3><strong>Fortune Cookies That Show What's Ahead</strong></h3>
<br>
<h4>Ingredients From The Past</h4>
<ul>
<li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
<li>1/4 c. confectioners' sugar</li>
<li>1 large egg white</li>
<li>1 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
<li>1/8 tsp. salt</li>
<li>1/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>
<li>10 strips paper (3" by 1/2") with fortunes</li>
<li>Melted chocolate (dark, milk or white), for decorating</li>
<li>Chopped nuts, for decorating, optional</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Directions From The Future</h4>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line 2 small cookie sheets with parchment.</li>
<li>In small saucepan, heat butter on low until melted; remove from heat. Whisk in confectioners' sugar, egg white, vanilla and salt until blended. Beat in flour until smooth.</li>
<li>Drop 1 heaping teaspoon batter onto sheet. With small metal spatula or back of spoon, spread batter evenly to form 3-inch round. Repeat with another teaspoon batter at least 4 inches away from first.</li>
<li>Bake until cookies are lightly golden 6 to 7 minutes. Loosen both cookies with metal spatula; flip onto flat sides.</li>
<li>Working with 1 cookie at a time, place fortune across center of hot cookie. Fold hot cookie in half, forming semicircle; press edges together.</li>
<li>Quickly fold semicircle over edge of small bowl to create fortune-cookie shape. Place in mini muffin pan to hold shape. Repeat with remaining cookie.</li>
<li>Repeat with remaining batter and strips of fortune paper to make 10 cookies in all, cooling cookie sheets between batches.</li>
<li>If desired, dip cookies in and/or drizzle them with chocolate, then roll in nuts. Place on waxed paper until set</li>
